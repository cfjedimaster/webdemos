Read the first part for the whole story.\r\n\r\nA\r\nGRA, Uttar Pradesh, India a As soon as my train to Agra leaves from Delhi, I find myself confused again. Iam lying on my reserved upper berth, though most of the train car beds arenat being used and almost all of the passengers are sitting on lower seats. I feel ridiculous, like Iam emperor of my train car, overseeing the rest of the passengers from above. Meanwhile, men pass by below me, offering a mysterious vegetarian curry out of industrial-sized buckets. I motion for one to serve me some on a paper plate, but when I try to pay for the food, he wonat accept any money. This is the first time Iave gotten anything for free in India. I conclude that the food is going to kill me.\r\n\r\nWhile Iam eating, the train makes a stop and passengers disembark, but the conductor makes no announcements. I canat see through any of the trainas tiny lower windows from my upper bunk. I have no idea where I am.\r\n\r\naIs this Agra?a I ask a man sitting below me. I ask as nicely as possible, in an attempt to avoid appearing as a self-righteous train car emperor, shouting questions to my serfs. After all, I remember, Taj Mahal-builder and Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan was overthrown by his son soon after the Taj Mahalas completion. The man below shakes his head and, in Hindi, I think he tells me that we still have a long ride to Agra. Another man walks by selling non-vegetarian food in foil tins. The first shots of an intestinal war have already been fired as a result of my free bucket food, so I decline. As the train chugs toward Agra, stopping at stations along the way, I find myself continuously recruiting new serfs below me to keep track of where we are. By the time Iam halfway through the journey, I have an eighteen year old kid, two Indian soldiers, and a young woman a none of whom can speak English a trying to assist me. Itas easy to accidentally aggregate helpers on the train; mercifully, Indians tend to be especially protective of clueless Westerners trying to make sense of Indian public transportation. At one point, the two Indian soldiers demand that a teenager move his feet resting on my berth, and the young woman makes food recommendations as buckets whisk by. Theyare kind of like four Train-Fairy Godmothers. Soon, I fall asleep.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, I awake to the sound of four Indians chanting aAgra! Agra!a in unison. I abruptly end my time as train car emperor, jump down from my bed, thank the four of them, and catch a taxi to my Agra guesthouse. Before he leaves, I arrange for my taxi driver to pick me up at 6 AM the next morning to take me to the Taj Mahal.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, I tell my driver to take me to the East Gate of the Taj Mahal. He promptly takes me to a roundabout near the West Gate instead a though his aEast Gate!a announcement upon our arrival is quite convincing. Indiaas perpetually dishonest taxi drivers always have ulterior (and sometimes mysterious) motives; in this case, he was trying to save gas by taking me to the Gate closer to my hotel and, according to Lonely Planet, possibly collect a kickback from camel and rickshaw drivers sitting near the West Gate waiting to take tourists to the Tajas ticket office. I donat bother to argue with him since thereas not much time until sunrise, and I walk quickly to the entrance. Standing in line with about twenty other mostly Indian tourists, Iam surprised to see a lack of Westerners a I imagined that every white person in India would be flocking to the Taj Mahal.\r\n\r\nFinally, the doors open, and I catch my first glimpse of the building considered to be the most beautiful in the world, one whose creator boasted that it made athe sun and the moon shed tears from their eyes.a I see the famous white, marble dome peeking through the arch of the Great Gate as tourists hold cameras high above their heads to get their first snapshot. I walk deliberately toward and around the Taj, soaking in the dawn, slowly taking photos from every possible angle. A handful of photographers gather in front of the adjacent Taj Mahal mosque with me to capture the sun as it rises behind it. Everyone is reverent, taking care not to interfere with othersa photographs and offering to help take posed pictures. The moment is perfect for the photographer gaggle: mist blankets the Yamuna River behind the structure, and the building looks like it has risen spontaneously from a clouded heaven, a concrete manifestation of nirvana.\r\n\r\nThe simple presence of the Taj, built as a symbol of eternal love by Emperor Jahan in memory of his third wife who died during childbirth, seems to encourage even rabid photographers to cooperate with each other.\r\n\r\nI spend almost two hours touring and photographing the Taj, walking around its walls, admiring the calligraphy on the entrance arch, gazing at the minarets, and touching the intricate lattice screens in the mausoleum interior. Iam just about finished, taking a few final classic Taj Mahal reflection pool photographs from outside, when a beautiful, young blond woman performing playful, provocative poses for her friends camera catches my eye. Soon, a string of Indian men, and some Indian families too, start interrupting to ask her to pose with them in souvenir photos.\r\n\r\naThe Indian tourists seem more interested in your white skin and blond hair than the white marble of the Taj Mahal,a I say to her. aIam pretty sure a lot of these Indian guys are leaving with more pictures of you than the Taj.a\r\n\r\nShe chuckles and introduces herself to me as Sophie, from France, and, quickly, weare trading funny stories of our travels through India. We like each other immediately. We find ourselves chatting in front of the Tajas reflection pool for about a half hour as Indian men gawk at us. But when Sophie and I realize that weare headed in opposite directions a she toward Amritsar in northern India and me toward Kerala in southern India a we share an awkward moment during which we realize that this is the one and only meeting of our entire lives.\r\n\r\nwell, it truly has been a pleasure, Hank,a she says. Her eyes hold on mine. For a long moment, she doesnat look away. I canat tell whether sheas staring at me or at the exquisite reflection of the Taj Mahal in the pool behind me.\r\n\r\nShe walks past me, in front of the rising sun. Then, she glances back at me one last time, smiles, and then shifts her gaze, once again, toward the world's most beautiful symbol of eternal love.","My father bought me a bicycle.","I just cracked an interview at IBM that made me feel happy like never before","I flew one of my RC model planes around in my yard.

Iam not sure why. In an effort to assuage it, I am sifting through old photos and there are some great ones from a holiday a few years ago. I had gone on a family holiday with my parents and two siblings to Munnar in the tea country of Kerala. We drove from Kottayam to Munnar and stayed for a weekend. That trip too was steeped in nostalgia as my father had grown up there.\r\n\r\nWhen the three of us were little kids, our favorite bedtime stories were the 'Munar Talesa narrated with infectious enthusiasm by my father. We were never satisfied with one and would try to wheedle more by pleading hard. His yarns portrayed what seemed to be an idyllic country life to the three of us who lived in a flat in Bombay in those days. There were tales of runaway cows, gardening attempts, going to school in the cold winter and throwing up on long bus journeys down from the hills. Munnar always seemed like a little piece of heaven to me. Around the time my father went away to college, my grandfather relocated to our hometown of Kottayam following his retirement. My father didnt return for more than thirty years in fear of tainting his cherished memories. He finally gave in when the rest of his siblings planned a trip to see if their old house, school and other favorite places were still there.\r\nMunnar still seems a lovely town to me if you stay away from the crowded and badly constructed main areas. But my father insists that it was much better sixty years ago when the British company Messrs Finlay Muir & Co ran the town. The town had grown due to the tea estates owned by Finlay Muir in the name of Kanan Devan Hills Produce Company. From electricity generation to hospitals, everything was set up and managed by the company but he remembers it to be an extremely well-run town. Even the roads were washed down everyday, he says. The company also ran the school where my granddad was the Headmaster and that my father attended. He recalls the Munnar Supply Association (MSA) being a shop for the British with many imported things that seemed exotic to him like cheese and preserves. We went in to take a look on that trip but there was nothing remotely exotic in there.\r\nLast year my parents came along on a location visit to Munnar to add properties for seek&hide. We stayed at one of our favourite homestays in Munnar, Casa del Fauno and were lucky that we caught both the glorious sunset and sunrise over a steep valley. My father looked so content and happy to be back in Munnar. The next day we visited another of our hotels in Munnar, Windermere Estate. The manager mentioned that the great grandson of James Finlay had stayed with them a while ago. So we were not the only people who were making nostalgic trips to Munnar :) If you look at these pictures, it will be clear why I am a wee bit sentimental about the place too.","One day I came home from a long, arduous day at work.

I'm not one to be overdramatic, but I really felt like my whole life had led up to that point.\r\nBackground:\r\nThree weeks into my sophomore year in college, I worked a study abroad fair and found out about this AMAZING program called Semester at Sea. Basically you go on a cruise ship that was remodeled to be a floating university and study with world-renown professors as you travel around the world. Four weeks into my second year in college, I had a stroke in my brainstem. I remember finding the brochure for Semester at Sea and bawling my eyes out because everyone told me I'd never walk, let alone travel internationally again. Fast forward a few years and I'd recovered amazingly well from the stroke but now knew I have a genetic disease which was making me pretty sick. I sign up for Semester at Sea because I can be sick at home or be sick traveling the world. The later has better vistas. I undergo experimental surgery which dramatically (although temporarily) improves my symptoms, pack up my bags, and am ready to go.\r\nAs embarkation day got closer, I grew more and more scared that something was going to prevent me from getting on that ship. I was going to injure myself or get worse symptoms again or there was going to be a bloody hurricane or something. I had already tried to study abroad twice but complications from surgery had prevented me both those times. When I finally walked onto the ship, I realized that I had made it. I was about to start living my dream against all odds. And oh man was it worth every bit of work and anxiety and hope I put into getting there. It was the best and most meaningful experience of my life and it was even better because I felt like I had earned it.","I went to chipotle and the server game me way more food than usual.","The offsite with colleagues was great fun.

Part of the challenge of a science of happiness is to identify different concepts of happiness, and where applicable, split them into their components.
